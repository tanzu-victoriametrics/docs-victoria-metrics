<strong>Warning: </strong>

**This topic begins with a brief description of what the product tile (e.g. Apigee Edge Service Broker for VMware Tanzu) does,
whereas the Overview section below describes what the service itself (e.g. Apigee Edge) does. See below for an example.**

This documentation describes the Apigee Edge Service Broker for VMware Tanzu. The Apigee Edge Service
Broker for VMware Tanzu enables developers to manage APIs for their VMware Tanzu apps through the Apigee Edge management console.

**Note**: This description appears under **OVERVIEW** in the tile's listing on
[Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

**The overview describes the service that your product offers to VMware Tanzu developers.
Make sure to overview the features of the integration.
Don't focus only on the overview of your product that is being integrated.
See below for an example.**

The Apigee Edge Service Broker for VMware Tanzu registers a service broker with VMware Tanzu and exposes its service plans on the
Marketplace. Developers can then create service plan instances using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command
Line Interface (cf CLI) and bind them to their apps.

Creating an Apigee Edge for VMware Tanzu service instance and binding it to an app creates an Apigee Edge API proxy that
handles requests for the app. This lets developers use the Apigee Edge management console to manage API request
handling between clients and the app.

**Note**: This overview appears under **OVERVIEW**, combined with the description above in the tile's listing on
[Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io).
